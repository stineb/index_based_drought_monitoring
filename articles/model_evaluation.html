</h2>
<p>“fLUE identifies substantial drought impacts that are not captured
when relying solely on VPD and greenness changes and, when seasonally
recurring, are missed by traditional, anomaly-based drought indices.
Counter to common assumptions, fLUE reductions are largest in
drought-deciduous vegetation, including grasslands. Our results
highlight the necessity to account for soil moisture limitation in
terrestrial primary productivity data products, especially for
drought-related assessments.”</p>
<p>We use fLUE predictions used in previous work as a target in a
machine learning based methodology to model this response not based on
conventional drought based vegetation indices but using an xgboost based
machine learning approach. We used a regression analysis to model fLUE
using a 10-fold cross validation and leave-site-out approach.</p>
